# Clustering & PCA Projects

This repository contains two unsupervised learning projects demonstrating clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques in Python.

## 1. Clustering – Digital Ads Data
**Objective:** Segment types of ads based on marketing performance metrics (CPM, CPC, CTR) to help a digital marketing company target more effectively.  

**Techniques Used:**
- Data preprocessing & feature engineering
- Calculating CPM, CPC, and CTR from raw data
- K-Means clustering & Elbow method
- Data visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)

**Key Results:** Segmented ads into distinct homogeneous groups for targeted marketing strategies.

## 2. PCA – Indian Census Data (Female Headed Households)
**Objective:** Perform detailed EDA and apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensions and identify the components explaining the most variance in the dataset.

**Techniques Used:**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data scaling & normalization
- PCA using Scikit-learn
- Variance explained plots

**Key Results:** Identified optimal principal components capturing maximum variance, enabling more efficient further analysis.

### Tools & Libraries
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
